This repo showcases a project at university that I initially completed in R. Out of curiousity and due to my desire to acquire new skills, I decided to built this projet in Python as well.
In this project, I use an ARIMA model to decipher an econometric time series, i.e., the monthly retail sales in the US. I downloaded the data from the FRED website a commonly used and very popular source for economic data and time series.
A special constituent of this project is the function created called "test_stationarity". Shout out to Learnerea for providing this information. Originally, stationarity of a time series is tested merely quantitively through statistical testing by formuating an H0 hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. Additionally, this function is supplemented by graphical visualization, thus, by rendering the rolling mean and the rolling standard deviation of the time series. If these time series don't exhibit a strong oscillation around their mean, the time series and the transformations of it's series can be considered stationary.
